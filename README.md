# Welcome， player!
# Thanks for playing our game!
# Our game is still under construction, so this version is really botchy. But we will continue sharping our works.
# Though botchy, this version can still be a DEMO for you to try our game because the main playing method has been completed.  More plot and mechanics will be carefully design in the following updates.
# Now let me tell you about how to play our game(We didn't put the palying method in the game because more playing mechanics will be added in the future versions).
# For part1, it's a Huarong Road Game. But unusually, players are supposed to find a key first before arrive at the destination.
# For part4, it's a Stone Crash Game. But what makes it special is that you should follow the order of "white->blue->green->yellow" to crash the stone. If the stone near the red stone is crashed, the red stone will be crashed together.
# In the end, we cincerely hope you can enjoy our game!
